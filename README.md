# Theme Engine

## Development guide

*This plugin is built with [Create Figma Plugin](https://yuanqing.github.io/create-figma-plugin/).*

### Instalation

Clone the repository to local, then

```
cd theme-engine
npm i
```

### Pre-requisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) – v18
- [Figma desktop app](https://figma.com/downloads/)

### Build the plugin

To build the plugin:

```
npm run build
```

This will generate a [`manifest.json`](https://figma.com/plugin-docs/manifest/) file and a `build/` directory containing the JavaScript bundle(s) for the plugin.

To watch for code changes and rebuild the plugin automatically:

```
npm run watch
```

npm run tailwind
```
